# Direct Vercel Deployment Guide

Since you're encountering issues with the GitHub Actions workflow, here's how to deploy directly to Vercel:

## Option 1: Deploy from the Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update favicon and prepare for deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Sign up/Log in to Vercel**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up or log in

3. **Import your GitHub repository**
   - Click "Add New..." > "Project"
   - Connect to GitHub if not already connected
   - Select your task-manager repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect that it's a React app

4. **Configure Project**
   - Project Name: "pt-task-manager" (or your preferred name)
   - Framework Preset: "Create React App"
   - Root Directory: `.` (default)
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (default)
   - Output Directory: `build` (default)

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your application
   - Once complete, you'll get a URL to access your deployed app

## Option 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI locally**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy Your Project**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to configure your project
   - Select "Create React App" as the framework preset

4. **For Production Deployment**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Troubleshooting Favicon Issues

If your favicon still doesn't show after deployment:

1. **Check the deployed files**
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Click on "Deployments" and select your latest deployment
   - Click on "Source" to see the deployed files
   - Verify that `favicon.svg` is in the correct location

2. **Test the favicon directly**
   - Try accessing the favicon directly by going to `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/favicon.svg`
   - If it doesn't load, there might be an issue with the file path

3. **Check browser support**
   - Some older browsers don't support SVG favicons
   - Consider adding a fallback PNG favicon if needed 

<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
